# Work In Progress
One Of The Biggest Program I Ever Made.
I Was Told To Create A Program For Manging Purposes By My School So I Created This.
One Of The Basic Purpose Of It Was So That Any Small Shopkeeper Can Save The Data Of Their Sales And Customers For Future Use.
The Graphs That Are Shown Are Completley Of No Use And Were Added Because We Were Told To Add 15 Graphs.
Other Than That The Tax Button Is Used To Add The Different Percentage Of Taxes Used In Different Type Of Shops.
For Editing Just Go To The Tax Option In Statistics And Then Tax Then Click On Update Tax List.
An Excel List Will Appear Now Just Add Your Percentage In Acsending Order As Given In Sample.
